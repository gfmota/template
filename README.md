# MicroService Template

This repo is a SpringBoot MicroService template to with some built-in tools. The idea is to be possible to fork it and start development without having to mind too much with enviroment configuration.

It contains several branches, the master contains the basis to every SpringBoot template, and each other contain an aditional tool. The bellow list contain all integrated tools and which branch they are in. The idea is so you can fork it and merge any branch that contain a necessary tool to your project.

## Tools
- Spring Web: make it easy to build HTTP APIs
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): add facilitators annotation to make code faster and cleaner
- [Checkstyles](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/): add code styles check to enforce code standards
    - Using [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/): code analyser to avoid code mistakes
